DATA: Our data is the basic information of the first 800 pokemon in the pokedex.

STATUS: Searching a list of pokemon by type and searching a pokemon's stats by name all work. The search bar will take any type of capitalization, however it will not take misspelling the name. Each pokemon name in the type search is a link to the pokemon's individual page. There is an api for pokemon by generation, but that was not implemented in the website.
